# Introduction #

This page provides a description of each `Translation` class currently provided by the MoniCA code base. Translation objects are associated with monitor points and can be used to convert raw input data into a higher-level or more meaningful form. A brief background is available on the IntroServerCode page.

## Abstract Base Classes ##
