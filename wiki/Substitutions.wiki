#summary Standard substitution templates.

= Introduction =

Several classes such as email alerts and alarm guidance text use a standard method !MonitorUtils.doSubstitutions which can replace special values in a template string with runtime variables such as the values of monitor points. This page serves to document the valid macro strings.


= Details =

The method signature looks like this:
{{{
public static String doSubstitutions(String template, PointData data, PointDescription point)
}}}

The arguments are as follows:
  * *template* the string which will have the macros substituted.
  * *data* The data which can be used for some of the substitutions. This can be null if required.
  * *point* The base point to which the substitutions should be applied.

The valid substitution strings in the template are:

||$V || The current value of the data. ||
||$V[point.name] || The current value of the specified point. ||
||$U || The units of the data. ||
||$N || The name of the point. ||
||$S || The source part of the point name. ||
||$D || The point's description. ||
||$T || The data's timestamp as a UTC time. ||
||$A || The alarm status of the data (true or false). ||
||$a || The alarm status of the data (ALARMING or OK). ||
