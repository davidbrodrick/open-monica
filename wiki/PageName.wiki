#The ISServer system has grown too large for just a README... here's how to get any external data into open-monica.

= Introduction =

ISServer is an external system class in open-monica which allows easy importing of "any format data", i.e. data you've obtained from scripts, greps, pipes, netcats and other quickfixes likely to survive longer than you ever thought when you hacked them. In very simple terms, ISServer connects to an instance of the ISServer.pl script running on any machine and sends the tickle string, or just sends the string "all" if you don't specify a tickle string. By default, this elicits the reaction on the server of blurting out your data formatted in a way conveniently ingestible by open-monica.

Here's how to use it:

* in `monitor-sources.txt` enter this line for your system: `ISServer 127.0.0.1:7111:5000:ticklestring` where 
* 127.0.0.1 is the IP address the machine running ISServer.pl, 
* 7111 is the port on which it's configured to run, 
* 1000 is the time interval to poll it at (in milliseconds, so 5000 = 5s) and finally, 
* the optional tickle string is the string sent to the server's TCP port to elicit the data you need. If not specified, all is sent which causes the default configuration of ISServer.pl to just send all the data in its data directory.
