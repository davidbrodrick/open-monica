= Introduction =

Many users will find it more convenient to view data from your MoniCA server
on a web page. This client library makes it easy to interface with the MoniCA
server and provides a number of ways of presenting the data on a webpage.

This client library requires the Perl client library, and includes a server-side
CGI (Perl) script for fetching the data, and Javascript code for dynamic
generation of the HTML pages.
