= POST Interface =

This accepts a POST query in JSON format which can query one or multiple points in a single operation. The result is a JSON object containing the requested data.

The query form action URL must be */points/*. eg `http://bullawa:8111/points`

== Get ==

{{{
{"type": "get", "points": ["home.weather.wind_speed", "home.weather.wind_dir"]}'
}}}

The result will contain the latest data for each point. If any of the point names were not known then there will be no data for that point. I all of the point names were not known then the status will be "fail".
{{{
{"status":"ok", "data":[{"name":"home.weather.wind_speed","ts":"2012-04-13 03:49:51.926","value":17.71,"alarm":false}, {"name":"home.weather.wind_dir","ts":"2012-04-13 03:49:51.926","value":163.0,"alarm":false}]}
}}}

== Between ==

This operation returns data from the archive in between the specified start and end time. Although the point names can be specified as an array, only a single point may be specified for this query:

{{{
{"type":"between","start":"2012-04-13 03:34:30","end":"2012-04-13 03:35:00","points":["home.weather.wind_dir"]}
}}}

The response should look like the example below. Please note that in the interests of efficiency the name of the point is excluded from the individual results of this query:
{{{
{"status":"ok", "data":[{"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:31.044","value":203.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:33.622","value":186.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:36.201","value":179.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:38.777","value":194.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:41.353","value":130.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:43.929","value":189.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:46.506","value":183.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:49.087","value":175.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:51.665","value":179.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:54.242","value":187.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:56.818","value":206.0,"alarm":false}, {"ts":"2012-04-13 03:34:59.394","value":179.0,"alarm":false}]}
}}}

== After ==

Queries the first values available for a set of points which are after or equals the specified time:

{{{
{"type":"after","time":"2012-04-13 03:59:00","points":["home.weather.wind_speed","home.weather.wind_dir"]}
}}}

Example result:
{{{
{"status":"ok", "data":[{"name":"home.weather.wind_speed","ts":"2012-04-13 03:59:16.265","value":9.66,"alarm":false}, {"name":"home.weather.wind_dir","ts":"2012-04-13 03:59:16.265","value":135.0,"alarm":false}]}
}}}

== Before ==

As with the "after" query above, except the query type must be specified as "before".

The server will respond with a JSON result like:
{{{
{"status":"ok", "data":[{"name":"home.weather.wind_dir","ts":"2012-04-13 03:31:39.600","value":200.0,"alarm":false}]}
}}}

== Between ==

To query all of the data for a single point between two nominated times you can use the following:

{{{
http://bullawa:8111/point/home.weather.wind_dir?start=2012-04-13%2003:34:30&end=2012-04-13%2003:35:00
}}}

The response should look like the example below. Please note that in the interests of efficiency the name of the point is excluded from the individual results of this query:
