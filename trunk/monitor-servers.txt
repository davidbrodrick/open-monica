#This file defines which servers should be offered as options when
#the client is started.
#
#Each line may be a comment, blank, specify the default server or define
#a new server. The format for defining servers is:
#name\tmonitor.server\tsecure.gateway
#
#Where:
#name: Symbolic name of the server/site/instrument.
#monitor.server: FQDN of the actual machine where the server is running.
#secure.gateway: SSH gateway to tunnel the connection through if the
#                server can't be contacted directly. Optional field.
#
#Fields must be TAB delimited as spaces in the name field are legal.
#
#A default server can be defined using the syntax:
#default\tnumber
#
#Where number specifies which of the server definitions to use as the default.
#The first server definition is number 1 (not 0).
default	0
