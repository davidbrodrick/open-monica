/**
 * This class creates an IceStorm topic and listens for requests from clients
 * who wish to obtain publish/subscribe monitor updates.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The process is basically as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The client creates a topic on which it will receive updates.
 * <li>The client sends a message to the server's subscription topic,
 * specifying the list of points of interest and the name of the topic on which
 * the server should publish updates.
 * <li>MoniCA will publish the latest cached values onto the topic.
 * <li>The client must periodically send a keep alive. This involves sending
 * the name of the topic to which the data is being published, to the
 * subscription topic.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * If the client doesn't send the keep-alive in the specified time then the
 * server will assume the client is dead and will destroy the topic, to prevent
 * buildup of stale topics in the IceStorm server. However for good practice the
 * client should also destroy the topic if it is being shutdown cleanly.
 *
